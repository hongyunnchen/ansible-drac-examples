# Ansible DRAC Examples

This repository contains example Ansible playbooks to configure and view BIOS
settings and RAID configuration of Dell machines managed via DRAC. A dynamic
inventory is used to pull information from OpenStack Ironic required for
communication with the nodes' DRAC BMCs. These examples are referenced in a
[blog article](https://stackhpc.com/ansible-drac.html) on the StackHPC company
website.
